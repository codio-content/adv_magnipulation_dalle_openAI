#### Assessment Question

1. Using OpenAI's DALL-E 2, generate an image of a plane in mid-flight. Save the generated image as `plane.png`.

2. Utilize the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to create an edge-enhanced version of the image you generated in the previous step. Save the enhanced image as `enhanced_plane.png`.


In this task, you will use OpenAI's DALL-E 2 to generate an image based on a textual description and then apply an image processing operation using PIL. The task involves two major steps:

1. **Image Generation with DALL-E 2**: Using OpenAI's DALL-E 2, write a function `generate_base_image(prompt)` that takes a text prompt as input and returns a URL for an image generated by DALL-E 2. The image should be 512x512 pixels in size. Download the image and save it as `plane.png`.

2. **Image Processing with PIL**: Next, load the `plane.png` image and apply an edge enhance filter using PIL's `ImageFilter.EDGE_ENHANCE`. Save the resulting edge-enhanced image as `enhanced_plane.png`.
